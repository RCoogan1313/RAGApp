The Motor Insurance Database
Information relating to your policy will be 
added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) 
managed by the Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB). 
The MID and the data stored on it may be used 
by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies 
including the police, the DVLA, the DVANI, the 
Insurance Fraud Bureau and other bodies 
permitted by law for purposes not limited to 
but including: 
> Electronic Licensing (Tax Discs). 
> Continuous Insurance Enforcement. 
>
Law enforcement (prevention, detection, 
apprehension and/or prosecution of offenders).
> The provision of government services and/or 
other services aimed at reducing the level 
and incidence of uninsured driving. 
If you are involved in a road traffic accident 
(either in the UK, the EEA or certain other 
territories), insurers and/or the MIB may search 
the MID to obtain relevant information. Persons 
(including his or her appointed representatives) 
pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic 
accident (including citizens of other countries) 
may also obtain relevant information which 
is held on the MID. It is vital that the MID holds 
your correct registration number. It is our 
responsibility to update your policy to the MID. 
We fully comply with the agreements in place 
with the MIB to update your details within 
seven days; however, it is important that you 
check your policy documents ensuring that the 
registration number is recorded correctly. If it is 
incorrectly shown on the MID, you are at risk of 
having your car seized by the police. You can 
check that your correct registration number is 
shown on the MID at www.askMID.com. If the 
registration number is not shown correctly on 
your policy documents, or you cannot find your 
car on the MID, please contact us immediately.

Please have these handy when you get in touch.
Other information you need to send us
If you get any communication such as any 
notice or form from a court, any threat of legal 
action or similar, please contact us straight 
away. We’ll deal with it or tell you what you need 
to do. You must also give us any other relevant 
information, documents or help we might need 
to process your claim, and pay any charges for 
sending such information. If you’re unsure if a 
document is relevant, please give it to 
us anyway.
Avoid increasing the amount claimed
You must not do, or refrain from doing, anything 
that would increase the amount of the claim 
without our written permission. For example, 
admit liability for, or negotiate to settle, 
any claim.
Paying the excess
For some claims, you’ll need to pay an 
excess. You can find your excesses on 
your car insurance details. Each driver 
may have different excesses. We won’t 
charge an excess if:
> You’re in an accident that we believe is not 
your fault and we can make a full recovery of 
our costs. Sometimes you may have to pay 
the excess while we’re looking into the claim, 
but we’ll refund it once it’s proven you’re not 
to blame and we can recover our costs.
> Your car is stolen from a private locked 
garage.
If you’re leasing your car or buying on 
hire purchase
If your car can’t be repaired and you’re leasing 
it, we’ll pay any claims to the lease company, 
because they are the legal owners of the car.
If your car can’t be repaired and you’re buying 
it on hire purchase or a similar agreement, we’ll 
pay any claims to the legal owner. We’ll only 
pay any remaining balance to you if you have 
the option to become the full owner at the end 
of the agreement.

About Protected No Claim Discount
The NCD owner will keep their No Claim 
Discount (NCD) if you make a claim, unless 
you make more than 2 claims in 3 years. 
Protected NCD doesn’t guarantee your 
premium – this may still increase if a claim 
is made.
This cover an optional extra for: 
Third Party, Fire and Theft
Essentials
Comprehensive
Comprehensive Plus
Check your car insurance details 
to see if this cover is included.
How it works
Once the NCD owner has a minimum of four 
years’ worth of NCD, you may be able to protect 
it by paying an additional premium. We’ll let you 
know when you’re able to do this. 
Protected NCD means that you can make up 
to 2 claims in 3 years of insurance in a row, and 
this won’t affect the NCD on this policy.
For more information, including a table showing 
what happens to the NCD on this policy if you 
claim, please see your car insurance details.

New car replacement
Included with:
Comp
Comp+
If your new car is stolen and not recovered, or 
written off, we’ll replace it with one of the same 
make and model.
When you’ll get this cover
We’ll provide this cover so long as:
> You’re the first and only registered keeper.
> If you have Comprehensive cover, your 
car is less than 1 year old when it’s stolen or 
damaged.
> If you have Comprehensive Plus cover, your 
car is less than 2 years old when it’s stolen 
or damaged. 
What we’ll do
We’ll replace your car with one of the same 
make and model if it has:
> Been reported as stolen to the police and has 
not been found.
> Suffered damage that this policy covers, and 
the cost of repairing it is more than 60% of the 
last UK list price (including taxes).
We can only do this if a replacement car is 
available in the UK, and so long as anyone else 
with an interest in your car agrees.
If a suitable replacement car is not available, 
or your car was not supplied as new in the UK, 
we’ll pay you the market value of your car at 
the time it was stolen or damaged. We’ll take 
any excess off the amount we pay you. If we 
settle a claim this way, the lost or damaged car 
becomes our property, and you’ll need to send 
us the registration document.
