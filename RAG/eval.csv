What we’ll do
We’ll replace your car with one of the same 
make and model if it has:
> Been reported as stolen to the police and has 
not been found.
> Suffered damage that this policy covers, and 
the cost of repairing it is more than 60% of the 
last UK list price (including taxes).
We can only do this if a replacement car is 
available in the UK, and so long as anyone else 
with an interest in your car agrees.
If a suitable replacement car is not available, 
or your car was not supplied as new in the UK, 
we’ll pay you the market value of your car at 
the time it was stolen or damaged. We’ll take 
any excess off the amount we pay you. If we 
settle a claim this way, the lost or damaged car 
becomes our property, and you’ll need to send 
us the registration document.

If you cannot drive your car after an accident or 
loss that’s covered under sections 2 or 4 of thisfrom our 5-year Guarantee. This means parts, 
materials and workmanship provided by our 
approved repairer are guaranteed for five years,
unless you sell your car or end your lease. Your 
car will not qualify for repair under our 5-year 
Guarantee if the cause is a lack of maintenance,
wear and tear, or a subsequent incident. 
Where we have agreed this with you, 
reasonable and necessary repairs can be 
carried out at a repairer of your choice. 
However, you must give us full details of the 
incident and we must approve the repairer’s 
detailed assessment of the repairs before 
the work begins. We may then make the 
arrangements for the repairs ourselves. 
Where the repairs are carried out at a repairer 
of your choice, those repairs will NOT be 
guaranteed by us even though we may pay for 
them directly. For the purposes of this policy, 
those repairs will not be treated as being 
carried out by our approved repairer.
If there is a problem with any aspect of theto blame and we can recover our costs.
> Your car is stolen from a private locked 
garage.
If you’re leasing your car or buying on 
hire purchase
If your car can’t be repaired and you’re leasing 
it, we’ll pay any claims to the lease company, 
because they are the legal owners of the car.
If your car can’t be repaired and you’re buying 
it on hire purchase or a similar agreement, we’ll 
pay any claims to the legal owner. We’ll only 
pay any remaining balance to you if you have 
the option to become the full owner at the end 
of the agreement.

policy, and this prejudices our position, we have 
the right to: 
> Refuse or withdraw from the claim.
> Refuse to cover costs – even if we’ve already 
agreed to them.
> Ask you to reimburse costs that we’ve 
already paid.
Choosing who represents you
You can choose an appointed representative to 
look after your interests. This will include looking 
after your interests in any inquiry or other court
proceedings, or if there’s any conflict of interest. 
Your appointed representative can be:
> From a preferred law firm that we suggest.
> Your own choice of appointed representative
– however you can’t choose your own 
appointed representative if it’s a contract 
dispute until it’s necessary to take your claim 
to court, or if there’s a conflict of interest.
If you choose an appointed representative who 
isn’t from a preferred law firm, they must agree 
to our terms of appointment. We’ll only cover 
their costs from the date they agree to our terms 
of appointment.
You’ll have a separate contract with your 
appointed representative. If they charge any 
costs that we don’t agree, you’ll be responsible 
for paying these.
Checking whether your claim has a reasonable 
chance of succeeding
Before we go ahead, we must agree with your 
appointed representative that your claim has 
a reasonable chance of succeeding. We will 
only provide this cover as long as we and your 
appointed representative agree your claim 
has a reasonable chance of succeeding for the 
duration of the claim. This can change during 
your claim. 
Sometimes the costs of a legal action may 
be too much in relation to the value of your 
claim, this relates to a legal test that is referred 
to as ‘proportionality’. In these cases, we may 
not provide further cover for your claim. When 
looking at how much your claim will cost to 
take legal action versus the potential benefit to 
be gained in pursuing your claim, we consider 
things like: 
> The difficulty of the case. Cases which are 
more difficult usually have greater legal costs
attached to them.
> The potential total value of the case. This 
includes the amount of damages you may 
be able to recover from the other party.
> The non-financial value of the case. 
Sometimes your claim will have a benefit 
to you which is difficult to value in financial 
terms but is still worth pursuing. For these 
claims your appointed representative will 
take the benefit to you into account when",What actions can the insurance company take if you haven't followed the terms of the policy?,"Helo, I recently had a situation where I didn't folow the terms of my policy, what actions can the insurance company take?","If you haven’t followed any of the terms of this policy, the insurance company has the right to refuse or withdraw from the claim, refuse to cover costs even if agreed to, and ask you to reimburse costs already paid.",2,23.0,"If you haven't followed the terms of the policy, the insurance company may cancel your policy, reject your claim and any following claims, keep any premium you have paid, and may involve the relevant authorities for potential criminal proceedings if fraud is discovered.","If you, any person insured under this policy, or anyone acting on your behalf attempts to deceive the insurance company, or knowingly makes a fraudulent, false or exaggerated claim, the insurance company may cancel your policy, reject your claim and any following claims, and keep any premium you have paid.","parking penalties), speed camera offences

Choosing who represents you
You can choose an appointed representative to 
look after your interests. This will include looking 
after your interests in any inquiry or other court
proceedings, or if there’s any conflict of interest. 
Your appointed representative can be:
> From a preferred law firm that we suggest.

appointed representative if it’s a contract 
dispute until it’s necessary to take your claim 
to court, or if there’s a conflict of interest.
If you choose an appointed representative who 
isn’t from a preferred law firm, they must agree 
to our terms of appointment. We’ll only cover 
their costs from the date they agree to our terms 
of appointment.
You’ll have a separate contract with your 
appointed representative. If they charge any 
costs that we don’t agree, you’ll be responsible 
for paying these.

chance of succeeding

a reasonable chance of succeeding. We will 
only provide this cover as long as we and your 
appointed representative agree your claim 
has a reasonable chance of succeeding for the 
duration of the claim. This can change during 
your claim. 
Sometimes the costs of a legal action may 
be too much in relation to the value of your 
claim, this relates to a legal test that is referred 
to as ‘proportionality’. In these cases, we may 
not provide further cover for your claim. When 
looking at how much your claim will cost to 
take legal action versus the potential benefit to 
be gained in pursuing your claim, we consider 
things like: 
> The difficulty of the case. Cases which are 
more difficult usually have greater legal costs
attached to them.
> The potential total value of the case. This 
includes the amount of damages you may 
be able to recover from the other party.
> The non-financial value of the case. 
Sometimes your claim will have a benefit 
to you which is difficult to value in financial 
terms but is still worth pursuing. For these 
claims your appointed representative will 
take the benefit to you into account when",What can the insurance company do if you haven't followed the terms of the policy?,"What are the potential actions that the insurance company may take if you have not abided by the conditions of the policy, especially in the case of Comprehensive Plus coverage?","If you haven’t followed any of the terms of this policy, the insurance company has the right to refuse or withdraw from the claim, refuse to cover costs, and ask you to reimburse costs that have already been paid.",1,23.0,"If you haven't followed the terms of the policy, the insurance company can cancel your policy, reject your claim and any following claims, keep any premium you have paid, and may involve the relevant authorities if fraudulent activity is suspected.","If you have not abided by the conditions of the policy under Comprehensive Plus coverage, the insurance company may cancel your policy, reject your claim and any following claims, as well as keep any premium you have paid.

that we or your appointed representative
think you should accept, we can refuse to 
cover any further costs.

We won’t withhold our agreement to take these 
actions without good reason.
When we might choose to settle your claim
We can settle your claim outside of court if we 
think it makes financial sense to do this. We’ll do 
this by covering you for:
> The amount you’re likely to be awarded by a 
court.
> The equivalent financial value, if your claim 
is not for damages.
Checking costs
We have the right to have costs:
> Certified by an appropriate professional body.
> Checked by an auditor (for example a Costs 
Lawyer) that we choose.
> Assessed by a court.
Recovering costs
If your costs can be recovered from somewhere 
else, you must tell your appointed representative
to do this. If we’ve paid costs that you then 
recover, you must pay the money back to us.
We’ll share recovered costs with you if:
> We refused to cover further costs and you 
paid more costs to end your claim.
> You paid the difference between the costs we 
offered your appointed representative and 
the costs they charged.
We’ll split any recovered costs to reflect who 
paid costs originally. For example, if you paid 
60% of the original costs, you’ll receive 60% 
of the recovered costs.
