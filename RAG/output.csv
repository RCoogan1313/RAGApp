you’re only claiming for windscreen or

Paying a deposit
When you collect your hire car, the hire car 
company may charge you a refundable 
deposit. When you return the hire car, this 
deposit will be refunded to you. This will be 
covered by the hire car company’s terms 
and conditions. 
Using your hire car
You may only use the hire car:
> While your car remains off the road or being 
repaired as a result of an accident, fire or 
theft covered by this section of your policy.
> Within the territorial limits, unless the 
hire car company gives you permission 
and appropriate insurance cover to use 
it elsewhere.
The hire car company’s terms and conditions 
apply as well as ours. They’ll give you a copy 
of these when you collect the hire car. If there’s 
any conflict between our terms and the hire car 
company’s, our terms will apply.
How you’re insured while using 
your hire car
While you’re driving the hire car during the 
hire period, it’s insured under your policy. 
Your cover to drive the hire car is restricted 
to the limits on use and exclusions shown 
on your certificate of motor insurance, 
and in the terms of your policy. 
If we need to pay a claim for loss or damage 
to the hire car, we’ll pay this to the hire car 
company. If you have an excess on your policy, 
you’ll need to pay this.
If you have Essentials or 
Comprehensive and remove your 
Guaranteed Hire Car Plus cover
If you remove your Guaranteed Hire Car Plus 
within 14 days of either your cover starting, or 
receiving your documents (whichever is later), 
we’ll return any premium you’ve paid. We’ll do 
this so long as we haven’t provided you with a 
hire car during that time.
If you remove your Guaranteed Hire Car Plus 
after this 14-day period, we’ll give you a refund 
that reflects the number of days of cover you’ve 
had, unless we’ve provided you with a hire car
during that time. If we’ve provided you with a

your claim is likely to succeed, we’ll ask you

Settling or ending your claim
Offers to settle your claim
You must tell us if anyone:
> Offers to settle your claim.
> Makes a payment into court.
If you refuse to accept an offer or payment 
that we or your appointed representative
think you should accept, we can refuse to 
cover any further costs.
Approval to settle or end your claim
Unless we agree, you must not:
> Stop, settle, negotiate or withdraw your claim.
> Dismiss your appointed representative.
We won’t withhold our agreement to take these 
actions without good reason.
When we might choose to settle your claim
We can settle your claim outside of court if we 
think it makes financial sense to do this. We’ll do 
this by covering you for:
> The amount you’re likely to be awarded by a 
court.
> The equivalent financial value, if your claim 
is not for damages.
Checking costs
We have the right to have costs:
> Certified by an appropriate professional body.
> Checked by an auditor (for example a Costs 
Lawyer) that we choose.
> Assessed by a court.
Recovering costs
If your costs can be recovered from somewhere 
else, you must tell your appointed representative
to do this. If we’ve paid costs that you then 
recover, you must pay the money back to us.
We’ll share recovered costs with you if:
> We refused to cover further costs and you 
paid more costs to end your claim.
> You paid the difference between the costs we 
offered your appointed representative and 
the costs they charged.
We’ll split any recovered costs to reflect who 
paid costs originally. For example, if you paid 
60% of the original costs, you’ll receive 60% 
of the recovered costs.

the right to:

> Ask you to reimburse costs that we’ve

Choosing who represents you
You can choose an appointed representative to 
look after your interests. This will include looking 
after your interests in any inquiry or other court
proceedings, or if there’s any conflict of interest. 
Your appointed representative can be:
> From a preferred law firm that we suggest.
> Your own choice of appointed representative
– however you can’t choose your own 
appointed representative if it’s a contract 
dispute until it’s necessary to take your claim 
to court, or if there’s a conflict of interest.
If you choose an appointed representative who 
isn’t from a preferred law firm, they must agree 
to our terms of appointment. We’ll only cover 
their costs from the date they agree to our terms 
of appointment.
You’ll have a separate contract with your 
appointed representative. If they charge any 
costs that we don’t agree, you’ll be responsible 
for paying these.
Checking whether your claim has a reasonable 
chance of succeeding
Before we go ahead, we must agree with your 
appointed representative that your claim has 
a reasonable chance of succeeding. We will 
only provide this cover as long as we and your 
appointed representative agree your claim 
has a reasonable chance of succeeding for the 
duration of the claim. This can change during 
your claim. 
Sometimes the costs of a legal action may 
be too much in relation to the value of your 
claim, this relates to a legal test that is referred 
to as ‘proportionality’. In these cases, we may 
not provide further cover for your claim. When 
looking at how much your claim will cost to 
take legal action versus the potential benefit to 
be gained in pursuing your claim, we consider 
things like: 
> The difficulty of the case. Cases which are 
more difficult usually have greater legal costs
attached to them.
> The potential total value of the case. This 
includes the amount of damages you may 
be able to recover from the other party.
> The non-financial value of the case. 
Sometimes your claim will have a benefit 
to you which is difficult to value in financial 
terms but is still worth pursuing. For these 
claims your appointed representative will 
take the benefit to you into account when",What actions can the insurance company take if you haven't followed the terms of the policy?,"Helo, I recently had a situation where I didn't folow the terms of my policy, what actions can the insurance company take?","If you haven’t followed any of the terms of this policy, the insurance company has the right to refuse or withdraw from the claim, refuse to cover costs even if agreed to, and ask you to reimburse costs already paid.",2,23.0

What is DriveSure?
DriveSure is our telematics insurance product. 
It’s designed to capture how, when and where

technology. We use it to understand your

means we can base your premium on your
driving record. 
What’s the difference between commuting 
and business use?
Business use provides cover for driving in 
connection with a business or employment. 
Your certificate of motor insurance will show if 
your policy includes business use and the type 
of business use you have.
Commuting is driving to and from a permanent 
place of work, for either part of the journey, or for 
the whole journey. This includes driving to and 
from a car park, railway station or bus stop as 
part of your journey to and from a permanent 
place of work.

> Refuse to cover costs – even if we’ve already 
agreed to them.
> Ask you to reimburse costs that we’ve 
already paid.
Choosing who represents you
You can choose an appointed representative to 
look after your interests. This will include looking 
after your interests in any inquiry or other court
proceedings, or if there’s any conflict of interest. 
Your appointed representative can be:
> From a preferred law firm that we suggest.
> Your own choice of appointed representative
– however you can’t choose your own 
appointed representative if it’s a contract 
dispute until it’s necessary to take your claim 
to court, or if there’s a conflict of interest.
If you choose an appointed representative who 
isn’t from a preferred law firm, they must agree 
to our terms of appointment. We’ll only cover 
their costs from the date they agree to our terms 
of appointment.
You’ll have a separate contract with your 
appointed representative. If they charge any 
costs that we don’t agree, you’ll be responsible 
for paying these.
Checking whether your claim has a reasonable 
chance of succeeding
Before we go ahead, we must agree with your 
appointed representative that your claim has 
a reasonable chance of succeeding. We will 
only provide this cover as long as we and your 
appointed representative agree your claim 
has a reasonable chance of succeeding for the 
duration of the claim. This can change during 
your claim. 
Sometimes the costs of a legal action may 
be too much in relation to the value of your 
claim, this relates to a legal test that is referred 
to as ‘proportionality’. In these cases, we may 
not provide further cover for your claim. When 
looking at how much your claim will cost to 
take legal action versus the potential benefit to 
be gained in pursuing your claim, we consider 
things like: 
> The difficulty of the case. Cases which are 
more difficult usually have greater legal costs
attached to them.
> The potential total value of the case. This 
includes the amount of damages you may 
be able to recover from the other party.
> The non-financial value of the case. 
Sometimes your claim will have a benefit 
to you which is difficult to value in financial 
terms but is still worth pursuing. For these 
claims your appointed representative will 
take the benefit to you into account when",What can the insurance company do if you haven't followed the terms of the policy?,"What are the potential actions that the insurance company may take if you have not abided by the conditions of the policy, especially in the case of Comprehensive Plus coverage?","If you haven’t followed any of the terms of this policy, the insurance company has the right to refuse or withdraw from the claim, refuse to cover costs, and ask you to reimburse costs that have already been paid.",1,23.0

When am I covered? 
If we’re dealing with your claim under sections 
2 or 4 of your policy, we’ll arrange for a hire car 
company to provide you with a hire car when 
both of the following apply:
> Your car is damaged because of an

We’ll provide you with a hire car from the point 
your car goes in for repair: 
> If you use our approved repairer, until they’ve 
repaired your car. 
> If you use your own repairer, for up to 21 days 
in a row while they’re repairing your car. 
If your car can be repaired, and is not driveable

> If you use our approved repairer, until they 
have repaired your car. 
> If you use your own repairer, for up to 21 days 
in a row while they’re repairing your car.

> Up to 5 days after our first (or only) payment 
has been issued to settle your claim.

If we cannot provide you with a hire car

repay your travel costs up to £50 per day, 
up to a total of £500 per claim if:
> You’re injured during the accident in a way 
that prevents you from driving.
> Your car has been professionally adapted

and a suitable hire car is not available.
> There are no hire cars available, and no

Settling or ending your claim
Offers to settle your claim
You must tell us if anyone:
> Offers to settle your claim.
> Makes a payment into court.
If you refuse to accept an offer or payment 
that we or your appointed representative
think you should accept, we can refuse to 
cover any further costs.
Approval to settle or end your claim
Unless we agree, you must not:
> Stop, settle, negotiate or withdraw your claim.
> Dismiss your appointed representative.
We won’t withhold our agreement to take these 
actions without good reason.
When we might choose to settle your claim
We can settle your claim outside of court if we 
think it makes financial sense to do this. We’ll do 
this by covering you for:
> The amount you’re likely to be awarded by a 
court.
> The equivalent financial value, if your claim 
is not for damages.
Checking costs
We have the right to have costs:
> Certified by an appropriate professional body.
> Checked by an auditor (for example a Costs 
Lawyer) that we choose.
> Assessed by a court.
Recovering costs
If your costs can be recovered from somewhere 
else, you must tell your appointed representative
to do this. If we’ve paid costs that you then 
recover, you must pay the money back to us.
We’ll share recovered costs with you if:
> We refused to cover further costs and you 
paid more costs to end your claim.
> You paid the difference between the costs we 
offered your appointed representative and 
the costs they charged.
We’ll split any recovered costs to reflect who 
paid costs originally. For example, if you paid 
60% of the original costs, you’ll receive 60% 
of the recovered costs.

About the policy
The policy is made up of:
	
> This booklet.
	
> Your car insurance details.
	
> Your certificate (or certificates)  
of motor insurance.
If the policy includes Green Flag breakdown cover:
	
> Your breakdown cover and your car 
insurance are part of the same policy.
	
> The policy also includes the Green Flag 
policy booklet we’ve given you.
If you have a policy that includes DriveSure:

and conditions we’ve given you.
Please read all these documents carefully  
and keep them safe in case you need them.
Words in bold type
Some of the words and phrases we use in 
this booklet have a specific meaning – for 
example, your car or modifications.
We’ve highlighted these words using bold 
type. You can find the exact meanings of  
these words in the ‘Glossary’ on page 4,  
or at the start of each section.
Comprehensive with DriveSure
If you have a Comprehensive with  
DriveSure policy: 
	
> Your cover is the same as a  
Comprehensive policy.

mentioned in this policy booklet,  
this also applies to you.

FAQs
How much will you pay if my car is damaged?
Where damage to your car is covered under 
your policy, we’ll pay the cost of repairing or 
replacing your car up to its UK market value. 
This is the current value of your car at the time 
of the claim. It may be different to the amount 
you paid or any amount you provided when you 
insured your car with us.
Who is covered to drive other cars?
Your certificate of motor insurance will show 
who has cover to drive other cars. We’ll only 
cover injury to third parties, or damage caused 
to their property, not to the car being driven. See 
‘Section 1: Liability’ on page 11.",What does the policy cover in terms of damage to your car?,"Hello, I recently got into an accident and I'm not sure what does the policy cover in terms of damage to your car?",The policy will pay the cost of repairing or replacing your car up to its UK market value when damage is covered under the policy.,2,0.0
