We can settle your claim outside of court if we 
think it makes financial sense to do this. We’ll do 
this by covering you for:
> The amount you’re likely to be awarded by a 
court.
> The equivalent financial value, if your claim 
is not for damages.
Checking costs
We have the right to have costs:
> Certified by an appropriate professional body.
> Checked by an auditor (for example a Costs 
Lawyer) that we choose.
> Assessed by a court.
Recovering costs
If your costs can be recovered from somewhere 
else, you must tell your appointed representative
to do this. If we’ve paid costs that you then 
recover, you must pay the money back to us.
We’ll share recovered costs with you if:
> We refused to cover further costs and you 
paid more costs to end your claim.
> You paid the difference between the costs we 
offered your appointed representative and 
the costs they charged.
We’ll split any recovered costs to reflect whoto as ‘proportionality’. In these cases, we may 
not provide further cover for your claim. When 
looking at how much your claim will cost to 
take legal action versus the potential benefit to 
be gained in pursuing your claim, we consider 
things like: 
> The difficulty of the case. Cases which are 
more difficult usually have greater legal costs
attached to them.
> The potential total value of the case. This 
includes the amount of damages you may 
be able to recover from the other party.
> The non-financial value of the case. 
Sometimes your claim will have a benefit 
to you which is difficult to value in financial 
terms but is still worth pursuing. For these 
claims your appointed representative will 
take the benefit to you into account when 
calculating the total value of your claim.
> If it would be reasonable to spend more in 
pursuing a claim than the benefit you would 
get in doing so.
Your appointed representative will assess thebut including: 
> Electronic Licensing (Tax Discs). 
> Continuous Insurance Enforcement.

apprehension and/or prosecution of offenders).
> The provision of government services and/or

and incidence of uninsured driving. 
If you are involved in a road traffic accident 
(either in the UK, the EEA or certain other 
territories), insurers and/or the MIB may search 
the MID to obtain relevant information. Persons 
(including his or her appointed representatives) 
pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic 
accident (including citizens of other countries) 
may also obtain relevant information which 
is held on the MID. It is vital that the MID holds 
your correct registration number. It is our 
responsibility to update your policy to the MID.

when you set up your policy.
If you can’t send us acceptable proof, we will 
remove the NCD years from your policy. If we

be removed which may increase the cost of 
your cover. We’ll write to let you know if this 
happens.

agreement, you must pay to us (1) all 
instalment payments that have already fallen 
due under the credit agreement and remain 
unpaid, and (2) the total remaining balance

paid the amounts due to us under (1) and (2) 
above, we may reduce the amount that we pay 
in settlement of your claim by the amount that 
you owe us. Alternatively, we may write to you 
asking you for the full payment.

refund that is due will be issued once the claim 
has been closed.

Store these numbers in your phone so you have 
them available if needed. Even if you don’t 
make a claim on your car, it’s important to let us 
know about the accident as quickly as possible. 
This will enable us to contact the other party

things like:

If you get any communication such as any 
notice or form from a court, any threat of legal 
action or similar, please contact us straightaway. We’ll deal with it or tell you what you need 
to do. You must also give us any other relevant 
information, documents or help we might need 
to process your claim, and pay any charges for 
sending such information. If you’re unsure if a 
document is relevant, please give it to 
us anyway.
Avoid increasing the amount claimed
You must not do, or refrain from doing, anything 
that would increase the amount of the claim 
without our written permission. For example, 
admit liability for, or negotiate to settle, 
any claim.
Paying the excess

excess. You can find your excesses on 
your car insurance details. Each driver 
may have different excesses. We won’t 
charge an excess if:

We can settle your claim outside of court if we

this by covering you for:

Lawyer) that we choose.
> Assessed by a court.

else, you must tell your appointed representative
to do this. If we’ve paid costs that you then 
recover, you must pay the money back to us.
We’ll share recovered costs with you if:

The motor legal helpline
You can ring the 24-hour legal helpline on

on any private motoring legal problem. It

for the problem or not. 
The helpline doesn’t advise on any claim you 
make under your car insurance policy. It can 
only help with problems to do with laws that 
apply in the UK.

policy, and this prejudices our position, we have 
the right to: 
> Refuse or withdraw from the claim.
> Refuse to cover costs – even if we’ve already 
agreed to them.
> Ask you to reimburse costs that we’ve 
already paid.
Choosing who represents you
You can choose an appointed representative to 
look after your interests. This will include looking 
after your interests in any inquiry or other court
proceedings, or if there’s any conflict of interest. 
Your appointed representative can be:
> From a preferred law firm that we suggest.
> Your own choice of appointed representative
– however you can’t choose your own 
appointed representative if it’s a contract 
dispute until it’s necessary to take your claim 
to court, or if there’s a conflict of interest.
If you choose an appointed representative who 
isn’t from a preferred law firm, they must agree 
to our terms of appointment. We’ll only cover 
their costs from the date they agree to our terms 
of appointment.
You’ll have a separate contract with your 
appointed representative. If they charge any 
costs that we don’t agree, you’ll be responsible 
for paying these.
Checking whether your claim has a reasonable 
chance of succeeding
Before we go ahead, we must agree with your 
appointed representative that your claim has 
a reasonable chance of succeeding. We will 
only provide this cover as long as we and your 
appointed representative agree your claim 
has a reasonable chance of succeeding for the 
duration of the claim. This can change during 
your claim. 
Sometimes the costs of a legal action may 
be too much in relation to the value of your 
claim, this relates to a legal test that is referred 
to as ‘proportionality’. In these cases, we may 
not provide further cover for your claim. When 
looking at how much your claim will cost to 
take legal action versus the potential benefit to 
be gained in pursuing your claim, we consider 
things like: 
> The difficulty of the case. Cases which are 
more difficult usually have greater legal costs
attached to them.
> The potential total value of the case. This 
includes the amount of damages you may 
be able to recover from the other party.
> The non-financial value of the case. 
Sometimes your claim will have a benefit 
to you which is difficult to value in financial 
terms but is still worth pursuing. For these 
claims your appointed representative will 
take the benefit to you into account when",What actions can the insurance company take if you haven't followed the terms of the policy?,What are the potential actions that the insurance company may take if the terms of your policy are not followed consistently?,"The insurance company can refuse or withdraw from the claim, refuse to cover costs, and ask you to reimburse costs that have already been paid.",1,23.0,"If you, any person insured under this policy, or anyone acting on your behalf attempts to deceive the insurance company, or knowingly makes a fraudulent, false or exaggerated claim, the insurance company may cancel your policy, reject your claim and any following claims, and keep any premium you have paid.
