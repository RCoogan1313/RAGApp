Making Motor Legal Cover claims
Accepting your claim
Before we cover your costs, we must accept 
that you have a valid claim.
We’ll only accept your claim if:
> The incident happened within the territorial 
limits – except where covered abroad.
> You were covered on the date of incident.
> The legal proceedings will happen in a court
within the territorial limits – except where 
covered abroad.
Following the policy terms
You must do all of the following: 
> Comply with all of the terms of this policy.
> Take all reasonable precautions to minimise 
the cost of claims.
> Take all reasonable precautions to prevent 
a claim from happening.",What must you do to have your Motor Legal Cover claim accepted?,"What must you do to have your Motor Legal Cover claim accepted?

Other information you need to send us
If you get any communication such as any 
notice or form from a court, any threat of legal 
action or similar, please contact us straight 
away. We’ll deal with it or tell you what you need 
to do. You must also give us any other relevant 
information, documents or help we might need 
to process your claim, and pay any charges for 
sending such information. If you’re unsure if a 
document is relevant, please give it to 
us anyway.
Avoid increasing the amount claimed
You must not do, or refrain from doing, anything 
that would increase the amount of the claim 
without our written permission. For example, 
admit liability for, or negotiate to settle, 
any claim.
Paying the excess
For some claims, you’ll need to pay an 
excess. You can find your excesses on 
your car insurance details. Each driver 
may have different excesses. We won’t 
charge an excess if:
> You’re in an accident that we believe is not 
your fault and we can make a full recovery of 
our costs. Sometimes you may have to pay 
the excess while we’re looking into the claim, 
but we’ll refund it once it’s proven you’re not 
to blame and we can recover our costs.
> Your car is stolen from a private locked 
garage.
If you’re leasing your car or buying on 
hire purchase
If your car can’t be repaired and you’re leasing 
it, we’ll pay any claims to the lease company, 
because they are the legal owners of the car.
If your car can’t be repaired and you’re buying 
it on hire purchase or a similar agreement, we’ll 
pay any claims to the legal owner. We’ll only 
pay any remaining balance to you if you have

Using your hire car
You may only use the hire car:

Other information you need to send us
If you get any communication such as any 
notice or form from a court, any threat of legal 
action or similar, please contact us straight 
away. We’ll deal with it or tell you what you need 
to do. You must also give us any other relevant 
information, documents or help we might need 
to process your claim, and pay any charges for 
sending such information. If you’re unsure if a 
document is relevant, please give it to 
us anyway.
Avoid increasing the amount claimed
You must not do, or refrain from doing, anything 
that would increase the amount of the claim 
without our written permission. For example, 
admit liability for, or negotiate to settle, 
any claim.
Paying the excess
For some claims, you’ll need to pay an 
excess. You can find your excesses on 
your car insurance details. Each driver 
may have different excesses. We won’t 
charge an excess if:
> You’re in an accident that we believe is not 
your fault and we can make a full recovery of 
our costs. Sometimes you may have to pay 
the excess while we’re looking into the claim, 
but we’ll refund it once it’s proven you’re not 
to blame and we can recover our costs.

garage.
If you’re leasing your car or buying on 
hire purchase
If your car can’t be repaired and you’re leasing 
it, we’ll pay any claims to the lease company, 
because they are the legal owners of the car.
If your car can’t be repaired and you’re buying 
it on hire purchase or a similar agreement, we’ll 
pay any claims to the legal owner. We’ll only 
pay any remaining balance to you if you have 
the option to become the full owner at the end 
of the agreement.
